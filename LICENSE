> **(Important Licensing Note)**
> This project employs a layered licensing approach.
> 1.  Individual source code files are governed by the **BSD 3-Clause License**.
> 2.  PHOVOS-distributed *packages* of "The Software" (including source, binaries, and accompanying materials) are governed by **CC BY-ND 4.0**. This means redistribution of modified *packages* is not permitted.
> 3.  Any code or data generated *automatically* by the project's inherent "quine-like" mechanisms is dedicated to the public domain under **CC0 1.0**.

The **full legal texts** (verbatim) for all referenced licenses appear after § 6 and control in any conflict.

# Definitions, Stipulations & Specific Applications

### § 1 Original Source-Code Files
*Individual files such as `.c`, `.py`, `.h`, configuration files, build scripts, etc., that constitute the project's internal architecture.*

-   License: **BSD 3-Clause**
-   Notice: `© 2025 PHOVOS:[PHOVOS@outlook.com](mailto:PHOVOS@outlook.com)`
-   You may use, modify, and redistribute these individual source files (or derivatives thereof) freely under the terms of the BSD 3-Clause License.
-   When redistributing these source files or binaries you compile yourself from them, you must retain the BSD attribution and disclaimer.

---

### § 2 “The Software” — PHOVOS Distributions
*The complete, bundled project as officially released and shipped by PHOVOS. This includes the source tree, documentation, build scripts, examples, and/or compiled artifacts (e.g., binaries, container images) as a collective work.*

-   License: **CC BY-ND 4.0**
-   Notice: `© 2025 PHOVOS:[PHOVOS@outlook.com](mailto:PHOVOS@outlook.com)`
-   This CC BY-ND 4.0 license applies **only** when you received "The Software" package directly from PHOVOS.
-   **No Derivatives Allowed:** You may not distribute modified versions of "The Software" *as a package*. You may only distribute verbatim copies of the PHOVOS-distributed package.
-   While embedded individual source files within the package remain BSD-licensed, the CC BY-ND 4.0 license governs the distribution rights of the *collective work* you obtained from PHOVOS.

---

### § 3 Third-Party-Compiled Binaries/Images
If you obtain the **BSD-licensed individual source files** (e.g., by cloning a repository) and build your **own** binaries, container images, or other executables:

-   License: **BSD 3-Clause** (the CC BY-ND overlay from PHOVOS distributions does not apply here).
-   Obligation: You must retain all BSD notices and disclaimers within your compiled artifacts. No additional attribution beyond the BSD requirements is required by *this specific license component*.

---

### § 4 Quine-Generated Outputs & The Definition of "Derivative"

#### § 4.1 Quine-Generated Outputs
*Any code, data, configuration, or other content emitted **automatically** by the inherent "quine-like" mechanism of "The Software" during its intended operation (e.g., a compiler's output, a code generator's output, a self-replicating configuration).*

-   Public-domain dedication: **CC0 1.0**.
-   These outputs are dedicated to the public domain. You may use, modify, and redistribute them without any restrictions or attribution obligations.
-   This applies *only* to content generated automatically by the software as its primary function, not to modifications of the software itself.

#### § 4.2 Clarification of "Derivative" for CC BY-ND 4.0
For the purpose of "The Software" package licensed under CC BY-ND 4.0 (§ 2), a **"Derivative"** (or "Adaptation") specifically refers to:

-   Any modification, alteration, or transformation of the *PHOVOS-distributed package itself*, its source code files *as bundled in the package*, or its compiled artifacts *as provided by PHOVOS*.
-   This includes, but is not limited to, changing the included source files, adding or removing components from the package, modifying documentation, or recompiling the provided source code with alterations from the original PHOVOS-distributed version *if intended for redistribution as a package*.

However, the act of operating "The Software" to produce its intended CC0-licensed outputs (§ 4.1) **does not** constitute the creation of a "Derivative" of the CC BY-ND 4.0 "Software" package itself. The output is distinct from the generating software.

---

### § 5 Attribution Block for CC BY-ND “Software” Releases
When you redistribute "The Software" (or a verbatim copy thereof) that **originated from a CC BY-ND package** supplied by PHOVOS:

```
"Morphological Software"
© 2025 PHOVOS [PHOVOS@outlook.com](mailto:PHOVOS@outlook.com)
Licensed under CC BY-ND 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)
Includes source files © 2025 PHOVOS: [PHOVOS@outlook.com](mailto:PHOVOS@outlook.com) under BSD 3-Clause.
Full license texts included.
```
This satisfies the attribution requirements of CC BY-ND 4.0.

### § 6 License Matrix (Quick Reference)
